# Contribution Guidelines

## Overview

RoamX welcomes contributions from the community to build a decentralized P2P data exchange. During the MVP phase (Q3 2025), this guide outlines the process for submitting pull requests (PRs), reporting issues, and collaborating on GitHub. All contributions must align with our code of conduct and technical standards.

## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful, inclusive, and collaborative.
- No harassment, discrimination, or offensive language.
- Follow the Contributor Covenant (see CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## How to Contribute

### 1. Report Issues

- **Template**: Use the provided templates (e.g., Bug Report, Feature Request).
- **Details**: Include:
  - Description: Clear summary.
  - Steps to Reproduce: For bugs.
  - Expected vs. Actual: Behavior.
  - Environment: OS, Foundry version, Arbitrum network.
- **Labels**: Add labels (e.g., "bug", "enhancement", "MVP").

### 2. Submit Pull Requests (PRs)

- **Fork the Repo**: Fork https://github.com/yourusername/roamx on GitHub.
- **Branching**: Create a feature branch (e.g., `feature/add-zk-utils`).
- **Development**:
  - Follow [contract structure](contract_structure.md) for contracts.
  - Use Foundry for testing (see [testing guide](testing.md)).
  - App changes: React Native standards, test with Expo.

- **Docs**: Update this guide or add tutorials.

## Tools and Standards

- **Foundry**: For contractsâ€”build/test with `forge build`, `forge test`.
