# Risks and Mitigations

## Overview

This section outlines the key risks facing RoamX, during the MVP phase (Q3 2025), and the strategies to mitigate them. Risks span legal, technical, and operational domains, ensuring the decentralized P2P data exchange remains secure, compliant, and scalable on Arbitrum with Starlink DTC integration.

## Legal Risks

### 1. Regulatory Compliance (e.g., OFAC Sanctions)

- **Risk**: Operating in restricted regions (e.g., Iran, North Korea) could violate U.S. sanctions, leading to asset freezes or legal action.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement geo-blocking based on IP geolocation to restrict access in OFAC-listed countries.
  - Consult legal experts to align token distribution and data sharing with international laws.
  - Maintain auditable records of compliance actions on-chain.

### 2. Data Sharing Regulations

- **Risk**: Local telecom laws (e.g., Nigeria’s NCC) may classify bandwidth sharing as unlicensed service, risking fines.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Partner with local ISPs (e.g., MTN) to legitimize operations.
  - Limit host liability by framing RoamX as a marketplace, not a provider.
  - Obtain legal opinions pre-mainnet (Q1 2026) for key markets.

## Technical Risks

### 1. Network Latency and Reliability

- **Risk**: Global WireGuard tunnels (e.g., Lagos to New York) may face high latency (150-400ms) or packet loss, degrading UX.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Prioritize nearby hotspots via GPS/ping tests; offer global as fallback.
  - Use QUIC (WebRTC) for better UDP performance; add multi-path routing (Q1 2026).
  - Monitor host uptime with Chainlink oracles; refund buyers for <80% performance.

### 2. Starlink DTC Dependency

- **Risk**: Reliance on Starlink Direct-to-Cell (DTC) for offline bootstrap could fail if satellite coverage is incomplete or disrupted.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Cache marketplace data via IPFS for offline resilience.
  - Partner with Starlink for real-time DTC status updates.
  - Develop Tor fallback for areas without DTC (Q4 2025).

### 3. Smart Contract Vulnerabilities

- **Risk**: Bugs in `Escrow.sol` or `UsageTracker.sol` (e.g., ZK proof validation) could lead to lost funds.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Conduct pre-deployment audits with OpenZeppelin or similar (Q1 2026).
  - Use multi-sig wallets (e.g., Gnosis Safe) for treasury and admin functions.
  - Implement circuit breakers in `Admin.sol` for emergency pauses.

### 4. Scalability Limits

- **Risk**: High hotspot growth (10K by Q1 2026) may strain Arbitrum or relayer capacity.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Optimize gas usage with Foundry’s snapshot tool.
  - Scale relayer with load balancers post-MVP.
  - Explore Polygon/ZK-Rollups for overflow (Q2 2026).

## Operational Risks

### 1. Host Adoption

- **Risk**: Insufficient hosts could limit data availability, deterring buyers.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Offer competitive $ROAM rewards ($0.05/GB net) and staking bonuses.
  - Run airdrop campaigns (50M $ROAM, Q4 2025) to incentivize early hosts.
  - Leverage community (X/Discord) for peer recruitment.

### 2. User Trust

- **Risk**: Concerns over privacy or payment disputes could reduce adoption.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Use ZK proofs to ensure privacy (usage totals only).
  - Provide escrow refunds for poor service (oracle-verified).
  - Build transparent on-chain reputation for hosts/buyers.

## Monitoring and Review

- **Dashboard**: Track risks via a custom dashboard (e.g., uptime, legal flags) on IPFS.
- **Reviews**: Quarterly risk assessments by DAO, starting Q4 2025.
- **Escalation**: Report critical issues (e.g., OFAC breach) to legal counsel immediately.

## Future Enhancements

- **Insurance**: Explore DeFi coverage for smart contract losses (Q2 2026).
- **Legal Fund**: Allocate 5% of treasury for compliance battles (Q3 2026).
- **Redundancy**: Add satellite mesh for DTC backup (Q3 2026).
