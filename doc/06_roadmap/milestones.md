# Milestones: Q3 2025 to 2026 Timeline

## Overview

This roadmap tracks RoamX's development and growth from the current MVP phase (Q3 2025) through 2026. It outlines key milestones for building a scalable, decentralized P2P data exchange on Arbitrum, with Starlink DTC integration and $ROAM token adoption.

## Milestone Timeline

### Q3 2025 (Now - October 2025)

- **MVP Launch**: Deploy core contracts (Escrow, ROAMToken, UsageTracker) on Arbitrum Sepolia. Release app with offline Starlink DTC bootstrap.
- **User Onboarding**: Target 1,000 users (buyers/hosts) in Nigeria and Kenya. Airdrop 10M $ROAM to early adopters.
- **Testing**: Complete unit/integration tests with Foundry; audit smart contracts.
- **Partnerships**: Initial talks with Starlink for DTC data integration.

### Q4 2025 (November - December 2025)

- **Beta Expansion**: Roll out to 5 additional countries (e.g., South Africa, Ghana). Onboard 5,000 users.
- **Feature Release**: Add fiat onboarding (Stripe) and Tor fallback for censorship resistance.
- **Token Unlock**: Release 5% of team/Investor $ROAM (30M tokens) with vesting.
- **Community Growth**: Launch DAO governance; host hackathons for DePIN innovations.

### Q1 2026 (January - March 2026)

- **Mainnet Launch**: Migrate to Arbitrum mainnet post-audit. Target 10,000 hotspots.
- **Global Scale**: Expand to 50+ countries with telecom partnerships (e.g., MTN, Safaricom).
- **Enhancements**: Implement AI-driven pricing and multi-path routing for reliability.
- **Treasury**: Allocate 20% of fees to community grants; vote on burn mechanism.

### Q2 2026 (April - June 2026)

- **Ecosystem Growth**: Integrate with Polygon/ZK-Rollups for broader adoption. Reach 50,000 users.
- **Burn Mechanism**: Burn 0.1% of transaction fees to reduce $ROAM supply.
- **Hardware**: Pilot Starlink DTC hardware contributions from hosts.
- **Compliance**: Finalize legal framework for global operations.

### Q3 2026 (July - September 2026)

- **Market Leadership**: Aim for 100,000+ users and 20,000 hotspots. Partner with major ISPs.
- **Treasury Diversification**: Invest in stablecoins/liquidity pools for stability.
- **Innovation**: Explore AI for network optimization and new use cases (e.g., IoT).
- **Sustainability**: Achieve 80% of operational costs covered by fees.

## Key Metrics

- **User Growth**: 1K (Q3 2025) → 100K (Q3 2026).
- **Hotspot Count**: 1K (Q3 2025) → 20K (Q3 2026).
- **$ROAM Circulating**: 10% (Q3 2025) → 40% (Q3 2026).
- **Revenue**: Break even on fees by Q2 2026.

## Dependencies

- **Tech**: Foundry upgrades, Arbitrum stability, Starlink DTC rollout.
- **Legal**: OFAC compliance, local telecom approvals.
- **Community**: Active DAO participation for governance.

## Future Vision

Beyond 2026, RoamX aims to be the leading DePIN for internet access, supporting 1M users and integrating with satellite networks globally.
