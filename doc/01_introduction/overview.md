# RoamX Overview

## Welcome to RoamX

RoamX is a pioneering decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace designed to revolutionize internet access by enabling users with surplus bandwidth such as those on Starlink or unlimited broadband plans to share or sell their unused data. Launched with a vision to disrupt the $1.7T telecom industry, RoamX empowers travelers, digital nomads, and underserved communities in remote areas with affordable, censorship-resistant connectivity, all while fostering a community-owned network.

As of September, 2025, RoamX is in its MVP phase (Q3 2025), focusing on delivering a seamless user experience and laying the foundation for global scalability.

## Our Mission

To democratize internet access by transforming wasted bandwidth into a valuable, shared resource. We aim to:

- Reduce roaming costs by up to 90% for users worldwide.
- Enable mobile data resale before expiry, maximizing value for all.
- Connect remote regions (e.g., rural Nigeria, Kenyan tourist spots) with innovative offline bootstrapping via Starlink Direct-to-Cell (DTC).
- Build a sustainable ecosystem with $ROAM tokens, incentivizing participation and governance.

## Why RoamX Exists

### The Problem

- **Wasted Bandwidth**: Millions of users with unlimited plans (e.g., Starlink) leave terabytes unused monthly, while carriers profit from high roaming fees ($10/GB).
- **Inaccessibility**: Remote areas and tourist attractions lack reliable, affordable internet, leaving users disconnected.
- **Centralized Control**: Traditional VPNs and ISPs impose restrictions, risking censorship and privacy breaches.

### Our Solution

RoamX offers a trustless P2P data exchange powered by:

- **Starlink DTC Bootstrap**: Provides 20MB seed data offline, enabling instant marketplace access without QR scans or USSD.
- **WireGuard VPN**: Embeds secure, global tunnels for P2P connections, connecting users to hosts anywhere.
- **$ROAM Token**: Fuels gasless payments (ERC-4337), staking rewards, and community governance.
- **ZK Verification**: Ensures transparent usage tracking with Zero-Knowledge proofs.

This creates a borderless network where anyone can roam freely, pay less, and own the infrastructure.

## Key Features

- **Offline Access**: Starlink DTC delivers seed data in dead zones, transitioning to P2P sessions.
- **Global Hotspots**: Connect to nearby or international hosts, optimized for speed and availability.
- **Seamless UX**: One-tap connection, real-time usage, and post-paid settlement with escrow protection.
- **Decentralized Trust**: On-chain transparency via Base, protecting buyers and sellers.

## Our Vision

By Q1 2026, RoamX aims to onboard 10,000+ hotspots, partnering with telecoms and expanding to 50+ countries. We envision a world where data freedom has no borders, driven by a community that owns and shares its network.
